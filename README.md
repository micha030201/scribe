## what's this

It's a discord bot to archive a Discord channel, by rendering every message in
it as an SVG image.

## it it any good

Nah.

A bunch of features are missing, or lay half-implemented, and the code quality
is absolutely horrendous.  I honestly could care less -- I can add whatever
needs adding and fix whatever need fixing if/when I need to run this again.

## why'd you publish this

I want the world to appreciate how absolutely filthy and disgusting it is.
